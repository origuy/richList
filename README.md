## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop only workflow
- Designed in figma

### What I learned

the project was very insightful for me i've learned:

- How to design an app from 0 to 100
- Design the UI and UX of the app
- Work with modern HTML syntax
- how to work with array and DOM manipulation
- work with modern array methods (filter, map)
- work with array.forEach()
- work with setTimeOut function
- How to work with forEach()
- work with uniqe attributes
- How to Orginze the code

```JavaScript
    setTimeout(() => {
        render(filterArray);
    }, 600);

    elementPerssed.path.forEach((element) => {
        // Code
    }
```

```CSS
	grid-column: 2 / 8;
		grid-row: 2 / 7;
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(8, $rootGridCol);
		grid-template-rows: repeat(8, $rootGridRow);

```




### Continued development

I will continue to focus on:

- more organized code and clean code.
- deeper understanding of front end subjects like SCSS and JavaScript and start learning libreries.
